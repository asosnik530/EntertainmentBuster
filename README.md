## Selected topic:
Which TV shows and Movies will have the most growth in the future?

## Why we selected this topic:
Our group noticed that we all have increased our use of Netflix over the past few years. As we discussed shows that suddenly became popular on Netflix, we started to ask what shows/movies would become the next hit? As a group, we thought it would be interesting to try and identify what show or movie would have the most growth in the future.

## Description of their source of data:
We will be using three sources of data to predict which TV Shows and Movies will grow the most in the future. We will be using three datasets from Kaggle. One of the datasets, "netflix-shows" provides the TV Shows and Movies on Netflix, details regarding the Country it was produced in, date it was added to Netflix, release year and duration. The additional two datasets from Kaggle provide the movies and TV Shows that are currently on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+, their IMDB ratings and genre. For these two datasets, we will be cleaning them up to only show the Shows/Movies available on Netflix. Once we have cleaned up both of these datasets, we will merge it with our netflix-shows dataset so that we can have one dataframe with each show/movie, their genre, IMDB rating, and the underlying details about each program from the netflix-shows dataset.

## Questions they hope to answer with the data:
We hope to identify whether a show or movie will become popular in the future? Is the program on Netflix? Which genres have the highest IMDB rating? Once we have identified shows that have the highest potential to grow, we want to look at the underlying information like which country it was produced in, what date it was added to Netflix and what was the release year

## Description of the communication protocols :
Our team will communicate via slack. We have also discussed the times that work best for us if we need to connect additionally outside of class hours.
